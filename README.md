# Project_0-Google-Search

A simple clone of Google Search, Google Advanced Search, and Google Images, built entirely with HTML and SCSS.

## Project Structure

* `README.md`: This file (you're reading it now!)
* `advanced.html`: The HTML file for the Google Advanced Search page.
* `images.html`: The HTML file for the Google Images page.
* `index.html`: The HTML file for the main Google Search page.
* `style.scss`: The SCSS file containing styles for all pages which has already been converted into '.css'

## Features

* **Search Bar:** Each page features a search bar allowing users to enter search terms.
* **Navigation:**
    * The main search page links to Image and Advanced Search pages.
    * The Image and Advanced Search pages link back to the main search page.
* **Basic Layout:** Mimics the basic layout of Google Search pages.

**Please note:** This is a purely static clone, and the search functionality does not redirect users to actual search results.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Using SCSS

This project uses SCSS for styling. You'll need an SCSS compiler like Sass or Libsass to compile the `.scss` file into a regular `.css` file.

1. Install an SCSS compiler.
2. Compile `style.scss` into `style.css` using your chosen compiler.
3. Update the HTML files to link to the compiled `style.css` file.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project! You can:

* Improve the HTML structure or SCSS styling.
* Add basic search functionality (redirecting to actual Google searches).
* Improve the layout to better mimic Google's design.
